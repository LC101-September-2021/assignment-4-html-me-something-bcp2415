          I stumbled into a job as a high school Latin teacher. It turned out to
          be fun.

          After a few years I wasn't learning as much as I had at the beginning.
          I got restless and decided I needed a Ph.D. in Philosophy. It was
          obvious.

          In graduate school, I learned to write my papers using
          <img

          />. This was my first step into coding.
        </p>

        <p>
          After finishing the Ph.D., I was hired as a post-doc in Oxford. This
          was a lot of fun: no end of challenge and learning. I published a few
          papers and gave a few talks.

          Then it was time to re-job. For several reasons, I elected to return
          to teaching Latin.

          I found more to learn in the new Latin job, and wonderful colleagues.
          But my learning again declined over time, and I miss being challenged
          in my work.

      <h2>Web Developer</h2>

          I've been studying web development technologies for the past couple of
          years, and hope to change careers in 2022.

        <p>Coding combines several things I loved about philosophy:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Logic</li>
          <li>
            Typesetting:
            <img
              class="latex"
              src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/LaTeX_logo.svg"
              alt="LaTeX logo"
            />
            makes any piece of writing look beautiful on the page.
          </li>
          <li>Git</li>
          <li>
            Vim: I wrote my di&varsigma;&varsigma;ertation and research papers
            in &xvee;im. &xvee;im and
            <img
              class="latex"
              src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/LaTeX_logo.svg"
              alt="LaTeX logo"
            />
            in combination separate content from arrangement on the page (or
            screen), thus removing an enormous distraction from a writer's mind.
            And once having learned &xvee;im, one can almost write without
            moving hands away from keyboard&hellip;dispensing with another
            distraction.
